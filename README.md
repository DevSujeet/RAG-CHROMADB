## 1. Problem Analysis and Planning

    Goal: Enable users to ask questions based on the contents of a collection of PDF files and get accurate responses.
    Approach: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine vector-based document retrieval with a HuggingFace LLM for generating responses.
    Components:
        Document Processing: Extract text from PDFs.
        Vector Database: Store embeddings of document chunks for retrieval.
        LLM Integration: Use an LLM to process retrieved data and generate responses.
        API Framework: FastAPI for the backend.

## 2. Detailed Steps
Step 1: Text Extraction from PDFs

    Task: Extract readable text from PDF files.
    Libraries: Use PyPDF2, pdfminer, or pytesseract for OCR if needed.

## Step 2: Preprocessing the Text

    Tasks:
        Chunk the text into smaller segments (e.g., 500 tokens each).
        Clean and preprocess the text (e.g., removing special characters, stopwords, etc.).
    Reason: Large documents need to be split to fit LLM and vector database token limits.

# Step 3: Generate Embeddings

    Task: Convert text chunks into dense vector embeddings.
    Tools:
        HuggingFace Sentence Transformers (sentence-transformers library).
        Use a pre-trained embedding model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

## Step 4: Store Embeddings in ChromaDB

    Task: Store the vector embeddings and metadata (e.g., source document, chunk index).
    Reason: Efficient retrieval during question answering.
    Tools: ChromaDB, which supports storing and querying embeddings.

## Step 5: Create a Question-Answering Pipeline

    Task: Implement a pipeline where:
        User asks a question.
        Convert the question into a vector embedding.
        Query ChromaDB to retrieve relevant document chunks.
        Combine the chunks and feed them into an LLM for answer generation.
    LLM Choice: Use HuggingFace models like OpenAI GPT, FLAN-T5, or similar.
    
    Implement Retrieval and Querying
    
    This step involves:
    
    Converting the Query into an Embedding:
        Use the same embedding model to encode the user query into a vector.
    Querying ChromaDB:
        Search the vector database for chunks (documents) most similar to the query embedding.
    Returning the Retrieved Chunks:
        Fetch the relevant chunks and their metadata to provide context for further processing.
## Step 6: Develop API with FastAPI

    Tasks:
        Create endpoints for:
            Uploading PDF files.
            Asking questions and retrieving answers.
        Handle the pipeline logic in the backend.

## Step 7: Implement a User Interface (Optional)

    Build a basic UI or CLI to interact with the system.

## Step 8: Optimization and Testing

    Fine-tune the system for better embeddings or prompt templates.
    Test with a variety of PDFs and questions for accuracy and performance.

Implementation Workflow

Weâ€™ll implement the system step by step:

    Set up the environment: Install dependencies and initialize the project.
    Text extraction: Build a pipeline for extracting text from PDFs.
    Vector database setup: Integrate ChromaDB for storing embeddings.
    Embedding generation: Generate embeddings for text chunks.
    Query and retrieval: Build the retrieval mechanism.
    Answer generation: Connect the LLM and generate answers.
    FastAPI integration: Build endpoints for the system.
